 * Which rung of the near-me radius ladder the listing is currently on

 * changes the radius, which changes serverFilterKey, which the existing
 * page-1 refetch effect already reacts to. No parallel fetch mechanism.
 *
 * Resets whenever the ZIP changes, so a visitor who moves from a rural ZIP to a
 * city one starts at 10 miles again.

 * See docs/LISTING-FIX-PLAN-2026-09-19.md TASK 2.
