/**
 * Pre-hydration switch for the near-me listings (2026-09-19, founder
 * decision D3).
 *
 * Without this the visitor sees three states: the server-rendered national
 * list, then the skeleton once hydration runs, then the ZIP list. The served
 * HTML has to keep the national list for crawlers (hard rule 6), so the list
 * cannot be removed. It can be hidden before it is ever painted, which is what
 * this does, and it is the only way to satisfy both rules at once.
 *
 * Runs during HTML parse, before the listing markup below it is parsed, so the
 * national list is never painted. Idempotent: setting the attribute twice and
 * registering the timeout twice are both harmless.
 *
 * The timeout is a hard safety net that does not depend on React. If hydration
 * never happens (a bundle 404, a JS error, an old browser) the attribute is
 * removed and the real list appears.
 *
 * It also starts the geo request (2026-09-24, docs/PAGE-SPEED-PLAN-2026-09-24.md
 * TASK 3). Until then useNearMe only asked once React had hydrated, so on a
 * phone the visitor's location was looked up AFTER the JS bundles had
 * downloaded and run, and the hidden list waited for both in sequence. Started
 * here, during HTML parse, the lookup runs while the bundles load. useNearMe
 * picks up the promise from window.__iwNearMeGeo and asks itself only when
 * there is none (a client-side navigation, where this script never runs).
 * Skipped when a saved ZIP exists: that path is synchronous and needs no
 * network. `iw:near-me` is useNearMe's STORAGE_KEY.
 *
 * Round C (same day): with `listUrl` it also starts the page-1 LISTING request
 * the moment a place is known, a saved ZIP straight away or the geo answer when
 * it lands, and parks it on window.__iwNearMeList. The URL is built the way the
 * listing builds its own default near-me request: the ZIP centre (never the IP
 * point), coordinates at 4 decimals (roundForCache), and the first rung of
 * NEAR_ME_RADIUS_LADDER. lib/near-me-prefetch.ts uses the parked answer only
 * when the listing's own URL is identical, so ordering, the ladder and the
 * filters are untouched; a mismatch just means a normal fetch.
