 *

 *      that expose bulk business data (clinics, providers).
 *   2. Anonymous limit/depth clamp — stop one unauthenticated request from
 *      draining the 4-connection database pool.
 *   3. NOISY_UAS — cosmetic log filtering. Not security. See the note below.
 *
 * Read the note on each before changing it. In particular, do not treat this
 * file as the enforcement layer for #1: it is the cheap outer gate, and the
 * authoritative check lives in each collection's `access.read`.

/**
 * User agents we drop to keep the logs readable.

 *
 *     curl -A "curl/7.88" .../api/clinics   -> 403
 *     curl -A "Mozilla/5.0" .../api/clinics -> 200
 *
 * It filters out lazy scrapers that never change the default, and nothing more.
 * Never count it as a layer when reasoning about whether a route is protected,
 * and never remove a real control because "the UA filter covers it".
 *
 * Side effect worth knowing: this also blocks your own `curl` while debugging.
 * Pass `-A "Mozilla/5.0"` when testing against a deployed environment.

/**
 * Payload auto-generates a REST endpoint for every collection at /api/<slug>,
 * complete with `where`, `sort`, `limit` and `depth` query support. That is a
 * full query interface, not just a read endpoint.
 *
 * Two collections must never be reachable that way by an anonymous caller:
 *
 *   clinics   — ~40k rows carrying business `email` and `phone`. Those emails
 *               are scraped contact data that the product promises not to
 *               publish until an owner claims the profile and opts in
 *               (see the `emailPublic` field in collections/Clinics.ts). The
 *               REST endpoint ignored that promise entirely and served the
 *               address regardless of the flag.
 *   providers — carries `licenseNumber` (a required field) and `email`.
 *
 * Nothing in this application fetches either endpoint. Every page and every
 * client component goes through a purpose-built route instead
 * (/api/clinics-list, /api/city-clinics, /api/clinics/lookup, and so on), so
 * closing these costs no functionality. That was verified by enumerating every
 * `fetch('/api/...')` call site in app/ and components/ before this was added.

 * against the staging deployment: `?limit=100000` and `?depth=10` together
 * exhausted the pool and a subsequent trivial request returned 504.
 *
 * `limit` caps the row count. `depth` caps how many levels of relationships
 * Payload resolves, and its cost grows multiplicatively rather than linearly,
 * which is why it is held much lower than the row cap.
 *
 * Signed-in callers skip the clamp so the Payload admin panel, which drives its

 * rejects a forged cookie. This function exists to reject the overwhelmingly
